# RDS Message Encoder and Decoder
This project focuses on the encoding (`rds_encoder`) and decoding (`rds_decoder`) of RDS messages, specifically messages type 0A and 2A. It was created as an assignment for the course [Wireless and Mobile Networks](https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/281019/.en) at BUT FIT.

See the `doc.pdf` file for more information regarding the RDS standard and the usage and implementation of the two programmes.
